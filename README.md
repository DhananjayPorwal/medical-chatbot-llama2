## Configuration ‚öôÔ∏è

### Custom Prompt Template

The chatbot uses a custom prompt template defined in the `model.py` file:

```python
custom_prompt_template = """Use the following pieces of information to answer the user's question.

- If the answer is not clear or if the information is insufficient, simply say: "I don't know" and do not make up an answer.
- Always use professional, accurate medical terminology when necessary.
- Provide only the direct answer to the user's question. Do not include any additional information or explanations unless explicitly requested.

Context: {context}
Question: {question}
Answer:
"""
```

You can modify this template to suit your specific requirements.

### Chainlit Configuration

- **Assistant Name**: Change the assistant's name in the `[UI]` section.
